ERC20, initialized at constructor with 100 DET owned by the creator.
Constructor also creates cDAI contract and saves its address as cDAI_contract.
Creator transfers DET to investors using standard ERC20 transfers.

mapping(address => uint256) DET_balances;

constructor:
    total_det = 100
    DET_balances[msg.sender] = 100
    cDAI_contract = new cDAI_contract...

Implement all public ERC20 functions.  Transfers use the internal transfer function below.

public foreclose(address1,address2,amount) - Used by cDAI_contract to foreclose DET of investors with negative cDAI balance.
    require sender == cDAI_contract
    transfer(address1,address2,amount).

internal transfer(from, to, amount) -
    require DET_balances[from] >= amount
    cDAI_contract.transfer_by_det(from, to, amount)     // Transfer the cDAI associated with the transferred DET. Requires the cDAI to be "free" (not staked or withdrawn)
    // transfer det amount from `from` to `to`
    DET_balances[from] -= amount    // Use SafeMath of course
    DET_balances[to] += amount    // Use SafeMath of course
    Emit ERC20 Transfer event.
